          <h3>Why you should learn coding in 2020</h3>

          <p>In this century, there are many skills required to become successful. Coding is indeed the most skills to</p>
          
       <p>Do you know that sinking feeling you get when you realize you have NO IDEA what you’re going to do next? When you make it to the final round of interviews and you don’t get the job. Or, when you stroll up to work, the front door is bolted, and a sign says “Sorry, we’re shutting down”? (That actually happened to my friend – no joke.)<br>

        Or how about when you take a long, hard look at yourself and realize you actually cannot decide “what you want to do with your life”? There are too many things in there! Too many passions. Choosing a career as a lawyer means giving up your dream of being a touring singer-songwriter, and following your love of coffee to the mountains of Peru means letting that dream of being an interior designer fall to the wayside.<br>
        
        But what if it didn’t have to be that way? Sure, you’ll always have to make decisions, but what if it didn’t have to be so black and white? What if you could do 3 things you love rather than 1, or what if you could decide to kindle your passion AND make the big bucks?<br>
        
        Laurence Bradford gets it. Like many of us she was trying to puzzle together her education, her dreams, and the logistics of making rent into a career path that makes sense. The answer she came up with is seriously inspiring, and, as you might have guessed, it involved picking up some pretty snazzy coding skills.</p>
    
        <p>Upon college graduation back in May 2012, I didn’t have a sense of relief. Instead, it finally dawned on me that as a history major, I was doomed.<br>

        What I mean is: I had relatively few career options. Either I had to switch paths or go back to school for a graduate degree.<br>
            
        Rather than making the decision right away, I chose to go to Thailand to teach English. Like they always do, one thing led to another. In this instance, my travel blog led me to learn WordPress, which then brought me to learning more advanced web development and design concepts.</p>
